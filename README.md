# packet-watcher-rs

## Prerequisites

1. stable rust toolchains: `rustup toolchain install stable`
2. bpf-linker: `cargo install bpf-linker`

## Build & Run

Use `cargo build`, `cargo check`, etc. as normal. Run your program with:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

Cargo build scripts are used to automatically build the eBPF correctly and include it in the
program.
